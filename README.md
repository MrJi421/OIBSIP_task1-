### Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java Swing application for a Number Guessing Game. It generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess this number within a limited number of attempts.

### Features
- **Guessing Interface**: Players can input their guesses via a text field and a "Guess" button.
- **Feedback**: After each guess, the player receives feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- **Limited Attempts**: The player has a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
- **Score Tracking**: The player's score decreases with each incorrect guess.

### How to Play
1. Run the application.
2. Enter your guess in the text field.
3. Click the "Guess" button or press Enter to submit your guess.
4. Receive feedback on your guess.
5. Continue guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.

### Implementation Details
- The application is built using Java Swing for the GUI components.
- A random number between 1 and 100 is generated at the start of each game.
